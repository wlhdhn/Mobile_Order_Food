# Mobile_Order_Food
This is a mobile application by using node.js.
I also valid the choices the customer input. If they input the choice which does not exist, I will give the error message and let them choose again.
I will give the whole details, price, tax and payment link when they finish ordering.
After they pay successfully, there will be a mesaging with sending time and location information.
