I got the user interface for the web from Pat Wilken.

To run:

1. The first time run `npm install`
2. run `SB_CLIENT_ID="AWb2RJ7r8EATJ43cTpvOVWtBzkOlWxJMo17HNwXztSpj2RIq7D1YtamrurOk_PdHWyxqmswXOtHbWs05" npm start`
   or Sign up for paypal developer sandbox(https://developer.paypal.com) and get your own client id.

3. Open 'http://localhost:3002/', SMS 'hi', then you can order food according to the instructions

Extend the order bot from assignment 1. You need to have at least 2 items on the menu unless your favourite food is pizza in which case you need to have 3 (I did pizza already). The menu items need to have size and one other attribute like toppings. You also need an up-sell item like drinks in the example.

For Assignment 2 you need to add paypal and a payment screen as in the scaffold.
