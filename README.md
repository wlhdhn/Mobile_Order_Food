I got the user interface for the web from Pat Wilken.

To run:

1. The first time run `npm install`
2. run `SB_CLIENT_ID="AWb2RJ7r8EATJ43cTpvOVWtBzkOlWxJMo17HNwXztSpj2RIq7D1YtamrurOk_PdHWyxqmswXOtHbWs05" npm start`
   or Sign up for paypal developer sandbox(https://developer.paypal.com) and get your own client id.

3. Open 'http://localhost:3002/', SMS 'hi', then you can order food according to the instructions


=======
# Mobile_Order_Food
This is a mobile application by using node.js.
I also valid the choices the customer input. If they input the choice which does not exist, I will give the error message and let them choose again.
I will give the whole details, price, tax and payment link when they finish ordering.
After they pay successfully, there will be a mesaging with sending time and location information.
